Hey there! I'm Felipe, a Finance Analyst at the National Treasury Department and a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at Fundação Getulio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I completed my Bachelor's in Economics from the University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil in 2012. In the same year, I started a Master's program in Economics at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro but didn't continue it beyond 2012. However, I completed a Master's program in Applied Mathematics at the same institute from 2019 to 2021 and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics there. My current interests are game theory, reinforcement learning, bandit algorithms and finance.

In terms of work experience, I started with internships at XP Inc. and BBM Bank in Porto Alegre, from 2007 to 2009. In the first company, I worked on the development of the risk control area, responsible for monitoring the positions of the broker's customers, while in the second I provided technical support to the commercial area of loan for medium-sized companies. Then, I worked as an Investment Advisor at XP Inc. in 2010. From 2014 to 2019, I worked as a Finance Analyst at the National Treasury Department in Brasília, in the federal state companies' area, where I returned in 2021. There I worked mainly with corporate law and business accounting.
